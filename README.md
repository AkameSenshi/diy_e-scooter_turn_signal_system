# diy_e-scooter_turn_signal_system
This is a self project for my Xiaomi m365 pro scooter and will work for all e-bikes and scooters alike. The project incorporates a cheap indicator and handle bar switch set and handle bar  lights. This project contains all the resources for that will be needed for fabricating this.
